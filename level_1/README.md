# Level 1 – Python Fundamentals

This folder contains the solutions for **Level 1 tasks** of the Python Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

The objective of this level is to strengthen core Python programming concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Tasks Implemented

### 1. String Reversal
A Python function that takes a string as input and returns its reverse.

**File:** `string_reverse.py`  
**Concepts:** Functions, string slicing, user input

---

### 2. Temperature Converter
A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user input.

**File:** `temperature_converter.py`  
**Concepts:** Conditionals, arithmetic operations, input handling

---

### 3. Email Address Validator
A function that validates whether a given string is a valid email address by checking format rules such as the presence of `@` and domain name.

**File:** `email_validator.py`  
**Concepts:** String validation, logical conditions

---

### 4. Basic Calculator
A command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

**File:** `calculator.py`  
**Concepts:** Operators, conditionals, user interaction

---

### 5. Palindrome Checker
A function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**File:** `palindrome_checker.py`  
**Concepts:** String manipulation, logical comparison

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x

## Notes
- Each program is implemented using a function-based approach.
- Code is structured for clarity and readability.
- This level focuses on correctness and fundamentals rather than advanced optimization.
